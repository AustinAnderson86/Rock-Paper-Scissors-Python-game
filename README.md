# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Python-game
Fun little game to learn Python loops and logic.

I edited the string to infrom the player of the cap sensitivity rule, as well as the no spaces rule.

This is a great simple project for individuals who are new to python, you can use a variaty of Python versions as long it supports the random package. https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html

From the random package we use the command randint which acts as our random number generator for the computer players Rock Paper Scissors output.
